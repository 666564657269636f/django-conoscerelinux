# Troubleshooting

## Pycharm not founding imports but runserver works
In pycharm to make django import works you need to set the `clinux` root folder as `source root`
To do this, right click on `clinux` folder go to the bottom of the menu, hover the option `Mark directory as` and select `Sources Root`
